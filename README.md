# Pok√©mon Themed Mixed-Messages 

a Pok√©mon spin on the Mixed-Messages Portfolio project üòÉ



### Watch where you step!

While traversing through long grass you will 

+ Stumble across a Pok√©mon
+ Fumble to summon a Pok√©mon of your own
+ Fight!

**Simply type 'node main.js' in the terminal to run the program *(you need to have node installed)***


### Please note:
if you're using bash as your terminal, the emojis will fail to load correctly.
I reccommend unsing powershell to run the 'node main.js' command.
